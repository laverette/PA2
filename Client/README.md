- Modern web browser
- SQLite (included with .NET)

### Running the Application

1. **Start the API Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd api
   dotnet run
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

2. **Open the Frontend:**
   Open `index.html` in a web browser or serve it with a local server.

3. **Login with Demo Users:**
   - Admin: `admin` / `password123`
   - Teacher: `teacher1` / `password123`
   - Student: `student1` / `password123`

### Development

The database is automatically initialized when the API starts. The schema is defined in `DatabaseSchema.sql` and includes demo data.

#### API Development
- Controllers handle HTTP requests
- Services contain business logic
- Models define data structures
- DatabaseService handles SQLite operations

#### Frontend Development
- Single-page application with role-based navigation

  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"password123"}'
```

## Deployment

### Production Considerations
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Set up HTTPS for production
- Configure CORS for production domains
- Use a production database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Implement proper backup strategies

## Contributing
